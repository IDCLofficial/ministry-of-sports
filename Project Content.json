He has served as Commissioner for Power and Chief Political Adviser to the Governor before returning as Lands Commissioner in 2025. He is known for reforming the land sector by eliminating irregularities, enforcing due process, and digitizing land records in partnership with the Imo Geographic Information Service (IGIS). His leadership promotes transparency and public trust in land administration. Barr. Onuegbu is respected for his professionalism, cultural values, and loyalty to the Uzodinma administration. Despite political speculation, he remains focused on delivering efficient public service without pursuing personal political ambition."
